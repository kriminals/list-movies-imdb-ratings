# How to fetch data in React with Hooks

You copy a list of the possible movie titles (one per row) and you get the imdb ratings for the movies.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Used the [Ant Design specification](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce), to build the user interface.

For this app I used the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)  to get an apiKey and have access to information about movies.

Deployed on Vercel, [Working demo](https://list-movies-imdb-ratings.vercel.app/)
