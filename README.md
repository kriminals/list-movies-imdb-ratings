# How to fetch data in React with Hooks

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You put a list of the titles (one per row) of the movies and you get the imdb ratings for the movies.

For this example I used the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)  to get an apiKey and have access to information about movies.

Deployed on Vercel, [Working demo](https://list-movies-imdb-ratings.vercel.app/)
